# one_time_grid_walker_v3.py
Used to generate "walks/runs" for One Time Grids

## Usage Notes
1. Requires Python 3.x
2. The target grid is hard-coded in the code. You can modify it in the setup_grid() function
3. The MAX_RUN_LEN, and MIN_RUN_LEN determine the maximum and minimum length of walks/runs. This is important if you don't have a limit on the number of "bends" a walk can make. 14 is the maximum length possible if there is only one bend, but if you allow multiple bends it can be set to much longer. The longer MAX_RUN_LEN is, the more possible walks are generated.
4. On line 54, `#bend = None` is commented out. This means that there can only be one "bend" generated by the walks. If you want to allow multiple bends, uncomment that line
